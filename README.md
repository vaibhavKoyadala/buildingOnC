BuildingOnC
===========
When I looked at how python was designed using C, I was <still looking for the right word here>.
I decided to build modules which can be used like modules in python or Java.
I did and I successfully used them in my projects. 
 
Modules:
-------
+ **Hash Table** `ht.c ht.h`
+ **Set** `set.c set.h`
+ **Vector** `vec.c vec.h`
+ **Json Parser** `jsonparser.c jsonparser.h`
+ Others ..

Essentials:
----------
+ **Logger** `logger.h`
+ **Macros** `macros.h`
